## Key Performance Indicators

### Total Q3 Cost

![Total Q3 Cost KPI](images/total-q3-cost.png)

The total Q3 cost metric displays the aggregate spending on BigQuery queries for the entire quarter. This KPI provides a high-level view of overall expenditure and serves as the primary indicator of our BigQuery cost footprint during the reporting period.

### Top User Cost

The top user cost metric highlights the highest individual contributor to BigQuery costs during Q3. This KPI helps identify power users and potential optimization opportunities by focusing on the most expensive user's query patterns and usage behavior.

## Usage Visualizations

### 1. Top Users by Cost

![Top Users by Cost](images/top-users-by-cost.png)

This horizontal bar chart ranks users by their estimated BigQuery costs, with color coding to indicate usage status (moderate vs. normal usage). The visualization helps identify the primary cost drivers within the team and enables targeted optimization efforts for high-cost users.

### 2. Team Usage Summary

![Team Usage Summary](images/team-usage-summary.png)

This stacked horizontal bar chart breaks down estimated costs by role and month of query execution. The visualization provides insights into how different team roles (data engineers, data scientists, data analysts) contribute to overall costs and how usage patterns have evolved across July, August, and September.

### 3. Weekly Cost Trend

![Weekly Cost Trend](images/weekly-cost-trend.png)

This line chart displays the estimated BigQuery costs over a 14-week period from Week 27 to Week 40. The trend analysis reveals cost patterns over time, highlighting periods of increased or decreased usage and helping identify any anomalies or significant changes in spending behavior.

### 4. Peak Usage Day (Daily Usage)

![Peak Usage Day](images/peak-usage-day.png)

This bar chart shows the estimated costs for each day of the week, identifying which days experience the highest BigQuery usage. Understanding daily usage patterns helps with capacity planning and can reveal workflow patterns that drive cost fluctuations throughout the week.
